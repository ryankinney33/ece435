  a.
      i.
         The first two bytes of the header are the source port, and is 43424
         in decimal.
     ii.
         The destination port is the second two bytes and is 53 in decimal.
    iii.
         The packet length is the third pair of bytes and the length is 42 bytes.
     iv.
         The checksum is the 4th pair of bytes. It is 0 if unused. In this case,
         it is enabled and is 9299 (in hex).
      v.
         Since the destination port is 53 and the packet contains a domain
         name, the protocol is DNS.
  b.
     UDP is much simpler and has much less overhead. It is mainly used when
     you want packets to be transmitted quickly and do not care about
     re-transmitting (like live-streaming for example).
