Name: Ryan Kinney

"Something cool":
	I modified the test.html file to have a size 1 header, a size
2 header, centering, a horizontal rule, changed the title.

Answers to Question 2:
a.)
 	  i. The requested file was not found on the server.
	 ii. The server refuses to brew coffee because it is a teapot.
	iii. The requested file is unavailable for legal reasons, such
	     as government censorship.
b.)
	  i. The maine.edu webserver was running nginx/1.16.1
	 ii. The location of the webserver has "Moved Temporarily".
	     It appears that the server is redirecting to a more
	     secure location (https://www.maine.edu vs http://www.maine.edu).
