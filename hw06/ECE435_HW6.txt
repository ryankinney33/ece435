    a. A webserver, considering the port was port 80.

    b. The useful data was 4 bytes and the whole packet was 70 bytes.
       Therefore, 4/70 or 5.714% of the packet was useful data and the rest
       was overhead.

3.
    a. The Macbook Air connected to the Pi and the TCP Three-way handshake happened.
       This can be seen from the sequence and ACK numbers, along with the flags.
       The Macbook Air connects to the Pi and sends SYN with a random sequence number X.
       The Pi responded sending ACK = X+1 and SYN with seq = random number Y.
       The Macbook responded with seq = X+1 and ACK Y+1.

    b. In the first packet, the Macbook sent the "Hi" to the Pi.
       In the second packet, the Pi tells the Macbook that the packet was received.
       In the third packet, the Pi sends the capitalized stringe "HI" to the Macbook Air.
       In the fourth packet, the Macbook tells the Pi that it has received the packet.

4.
    a. Do not need to worry about the tcp/CLOSE-WAIT connections because the remote end has
       shutdown the connection and the computer is waiting for a termination request.

    b. The tcp/ESTAB connections are the open two-way connections in-which data is being
       communicated. These are likely candidates for the high activity.

    c. The tcp/SYN-RECV connections are incoming connections that have not been ACK'd yet.
       These are also possible candidates for the high activity.

    d. The tcp/TIME-WAIT do not need to be worried about. They have already closed and are
       waiting around to handle any delayed packets.

    e. The udp/UNCONN are closed connections and do not need to be worried about.

    f. The tcp/LISTEN connections are waiting for an incoming connection and are not transmitting
       data. Do not worry about them.

5.
	What probably happened is a ton of packets are being dropped. If there is a lot of congestion
	on the network, then packet loss is common. With TCP, the packets would need to be resent and
	could possibly be getting dropped again.
