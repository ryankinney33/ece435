		S/N_dB = 10*log10(25) = 13.9794 dB.
	b.
		S/N_dB = 17 dB = 10*log10(S/N) ==> S/N = 10^(17/10) = 50.1187
		bps = 100e6*log2(1 + 50.1187) = 5.64728e8
		Maximum transmission speed = 5.647 Mbps

	a.
		It uses fewer repeaters, has lower corrosion rates. Fiber is also immune
		to power surges and power failures. For example, if the line gets hit by
		lightning, fiber will not have a power surge.
	b.
		Long distance communications are cheaper and easier. For example, a 1000+ mile
		long trench around a mountain may need to be dug and maintained or the same
		connection may be accomplished with only a few sattelites.
	c.
		The communication across fiber is more private, as it is harder to be
		intercepted. Anybody with a dish can intercept the satellite connection,
		but the same cannot be said for fiber. And even when fiber is successfully
		tapped into, it is very difficult to do so without weakening the signal
		strength in the fiber line.

	a.
		This is technically possible, but not a good idea. The government,
		(FCC in the US) will get angry.
