	a.
		S/N_dB = 10*log10(25) = 13.9794 dB.
	b.
		S/N_dB = 17 dB = 10*log10(S/N) ==> S/N = 10^(17/10) = 50.1187
		bps = 100e6*log2(1 + 50.1187) = 5.64728e8
		Maximum transmission speed = 5.647 Mbps
2.
	a.
		It uses fewer repeaters, has lower corrosion rates. Fiber is also immune
		to power surges and power failures. For example, if the line gets hit by
		lightning, fiber will not have a power surge.
	b.
		Long distance communications are easier. For example, a 1000+ mile long
		trench may need to be dug and maintained or the same could be accomplished
		with only a few sattelites. 
	c.
		Fiber is less affected by weather. For example, rain can greatly diminish
		the signal quality and even make it impossible to receive.

3.
	a.
		This is technically possible, but not a good idea. The government,
		(FCC in the US) will get angry.
