1.
     i.
	The md5 sum for the original file was:
	6c5cfaceac22c5c46778588c1986a8a1
    ii.
	After modifying the homework number from 3 to 2, the md5 sum was:
	bb7baecdd2d3d0a70accebb17523e6e2
   iii.
	The SHA-256 sum for the modified file was:
	1e3b699e590e0abdb7b0c07849456fe39a3373a295f741237b5eed808a49a452
	It is much larger than the md5 sum (256 bits vs 128), making collisions much less likely.
