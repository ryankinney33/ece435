Homework 3

1.
    i.
        The md5 sum for the original file was:
        6c5cfaceac22c5c46778588c1986a8a1
   ii.
        After modifying the homework number from 3 to 2, the md5 sum was:
        bb7baecdd2d3d0a70accebb17523e6e2
  iii.
        The SHA-256 sum for the modified file was:
        1e3b699e590e0abdb7b0c07849456fe39a3373a295f741237b5eed808a49a452
        It is much larger than the md5 sum (256 bits vs 128), making collisions much less likely.
2.
    a.
        i.
            GPG found a good signature, so the key was signed by you.
            After modifying the file, it is no longer verified.
       ii.
            The key itself would have to be signed and that key would have to be signed...
            It would depend on trust, whether personal trust or from a Certificate Authority.
    b.
        In theory the secret message says:
           
3.
    a.
        SHA-256 uses more bits than SHA-1 (256 instead of 160), making collisions much less common. Also, SHA-1 was "broken" in 2017.
    b.
