	a.
		It watches for incoming frames and keeps track of their source addresses
		in a table. When the destination is unknown, it broadcasts to all. Once
		the destination also sends a frame, the table is updated and no longer
		broadcasts.
	b.
		One reason is bandwidth concerns. By splitting a network up, there is less
		of a chance for collisions to occur. In addition, a machine on a different
		network does not affect the ability for a machine to transmit on its own
		network, allowing for more data to be transmitted at a given time.

	a.
		P = 1W * 10^(31/10)/1000
		P = 1.259W
	b.
		A microwave oven may be interfering with the connection, which is legal. The
		frequency band in which WiFi operates in is an ISM band, which are generally
		open.
	c.
		CSMA/CD is used to detect collisions. A machine would wait for the line to be
		idle before starting to transmit. If two machines started transmitting,
		simultaneously, a collision would occur and they would back off.
		They would then wait a random amount of time before transmitting again.

		CSMA/CA is used to avoid collisions. When a device wants to transmit, it
		looks to see if the channel is clear. If clear, it waits a random time before
		transmitting to avoid two waiters from starting simultaneously. If the channel
		is busy, the device waits a random backoff time before starting. The device
		waits for the receiver to send an ACK. If the ACK is not received, then it backs
		off and retries.

		One reason the wired Ethernet methodology was not used is due to the hidden
		station problem. If machine A is in the range of B and machine B is in the range
		of C, but A is not in the range of C, then they wont know if there was a collision.
