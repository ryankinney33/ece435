BEGIN Ethernet HEADER	Name of Field		Decoded Value
0x0000: 0013 3b10 667f	Destination 		00:13:3b:10:66:7f
0x0006: b827 ebaf 3711	Source  		5*4 = 20 bytes
0x000c: 0800	        Type/Length		IPv4
END Ethernet HEADER

    b.
        The OUI of the destination is 00:13:3b, which is Speed Dragon Multimedia Limited.
        The OUI of the source is b8:27:eb, which is Raspberry Pi Foundation.

    c.
        The destination MAC address is not the MAC address of 130.11.46.127. The MAC
        address corresponds to the gateway machine.

2.
    a.
        The protocol is ARP -- address resolution protocol
    b.
        It is used to map an IP address to a MAC address. If the machine does not know
        which MAC corresponds to a local IP address, it will broadcast "who-has IP",
        and the corresponding machine will respond.

    a.
        Ethernet won because it was simpler and therefore cheaper than Token Ring
    b.
        The minimum frame size of 64 bytes was set so that the signal had enough
        time to propagate down the cable and all the transmitters could notice
        collisions.
    c.
        The maximum frame size was set to decrease the maximum possible network delay.
        For example, very large frames will tie up the the network for longer.
        For example, if Machine A is trying to send many small packets and Machine B
        is sending a few large packets, then Machine A may have to wait a long time
        for Machine B to finish.
    d.
        If the CRC is invalid, then the frame is silently dropped.

       i.
            00:25:90:e3:57:34
      ii.
           The OUI is 00:25:90 and corresponds to Super Micro Computer, Inc.
     iii.
           The MTU is 1500 bytes.
      iv.
           76139606874 bytes received
       v.
           18280800017 bytes transmitted
      vi.
           0 collisions detected
     vii.
           0 packets dropped
    viii.
           If the collision count is low, then the network may have very few machines
           transmitting.
